## Instructions

- Download the apk from above [(https://github.com/eman2XR/Stargazer-FBXRHackathon21/raw/main/STARGAZER%20build%200.043.apk)]  
- Sideload to headset and open from Unknown Sources
- Use the controllers to point and grab the walls around you and align them with the real walls in your room 
- Grab the room setup UI the same way as the walls, then point and click on the 'Confirm Setup' button

### Available Voice Commands
- "open roof"
- "play music"
- "reset" (restarts the experience)
- "open window" command seen in the video has been removed

**Note:** 
The current setup process to align the virtual walls with the real ones is not very intuitive and requires some manual adjustment. It also might not work for everyone depending on your room layout. If it proves to difficult to make the alignment, you can just try to roughly align by recentering (long press the oculus menu button on your right controller) and then confirm the setup.
